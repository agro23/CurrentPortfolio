# Current Portfolio

### By Andy Grossberg

## Description
A .Net portfolio with blog and user comments.

## Rules

This is a personal portfolio site. I'll be building this same project for the next two Fridays.

The site must include:

* A landing page featuring an image of yourself or an image that expresses your style.
* A blog section featuring your posts. You are not required to write any posts for this project.

* Users should be able to:
  - comment on specific blog posts Iâ€™ve made.
  - see all previous comments left on blog posts. (All comments should have body and author fields)

* I should be able to log on/off as an administrator for my portfolio.
  - I can choose to either seed my database with an admin username and password, or include a registration page to register.

* At the admin level I should be able to:
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog entries.
    * (I will Use AJAX for the GET methods for this)
  - Create comments and view and remove comments anywhere on the site.

* My site must include:
    - My work experience
    - My relevant skills
    - My education
    - How I got into coding
    - A personal story and interests
    - Contact information (link to GH, linkedin)
    - My Your personal and work projects

* Maybe Remove or Block users

## Specifications

## Methodology and Comments

This week we studied Authentication and AJAX and so I'm using those class projects as inspiration for the back end of the app. The last two-week project had reviews and those are the same as comments so I will use something similar in structure.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* C#

There is room to separate the Admin from Users but not in the short term. In order to keep updating this site I will have to do so.
